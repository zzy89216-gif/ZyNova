## ✨ What's new in 28.0.2

- **SakuraFrp audited line-by-line against the official OpenAPI**: the unstable `export` / `remote` fields are now decoded tolerantly (that was the real-device `Unable to decode tunnels`), so the tunnel list finally loads
- **Port auto-detection actually works on real devices now**: Android 10+ blocks `/proc/net/tcp`, so it falls back to the game log line `Local game hosted on port` that vanilla always writes when you open to LAN
- **Editing a tunnel no longer pretends to rename it**: the official API has no `name` field on edit — the dialog now only changes the local port and note, and says so
- **Delete failures and creation warnings are surfaced**: the `failed` list tells you to check the panel, and `important_warning_for_ai` (public servers must use a "multi-line" node) is shown instead of being dropped
- **New "Open source & compliance" block on the About page**: GPL-3.0 text / third-party notices / source links, plus version name (code) · package name and a prominent **Terracotta = AGPL-3.0** notice

## 🛠️ Features

- **AI Agent**: DeepSeek by default — installs the game, modpacks and mods, edits configs, reads logs, launches the game
- **Renderers**: Auto / MobileGlues / GL4ES / LTW (experimental)
- **Resource core**: Modrinth / CurseForge search, dependency resolution, download, verification, install
- **Favorites & archive**: online favorites plus a private archive with SHA-256 dedupe
- **Preload API guard**: Fabric API / Quilted Fabric API / Legacy Fabric API are added by the install flow and can't be duplicated, searched, deleted or disabled manually
